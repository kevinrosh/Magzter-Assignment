			<p>The OnePlus 10 is a beautiful smartphone. From the smooth glass to the unusually shaped camera module that adds so much visual interest to an otherwise ordinary shape, it grabs your attention, and the textured alert slider adds some much-needed physical interaction to give it some personality.It’s slim at 8.5mm and modestly weighted at 205 grams. I’ve been using it without a case and do find it a little slippery. It will slide around on smooth surfaces too, so beware when you think it’s secure because it may have other ideas.</p>
